## About Me
I am a Junior Data Scientist / Data Analyst with training from an intensive data science bootcamp.
I have hands-on experience working with real-world datasets, exploratory data analysis, and
classification models such as churn prediction.

I previously worked in legal operations for U.S.-based clients, which strengthened my attention
to detail, data handling, and communication with stakeholders.
